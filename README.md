TruthFort-News-Detection
A lightweight Flask-based web app that lets users register, log in, and check whether a news headline or statement is likely to be real or fake.
The system uses a trained machine-learning model (TF–IDF + Logistic Regression) along with the NewsAPI to cross-verify articles from trusted sources.
Includes daily usage limits, a simple SQLite user database, and a clean browser-based UI for quick fact-checking.
